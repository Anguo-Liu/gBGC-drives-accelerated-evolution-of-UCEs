This repository contains scripts and pipelines used in gBGC-drives-accelerated-evolution-of-UCEs project. Most of the scripts were specially designed to perform the analyses in the paper ```GC-biased gene conversion drives accelerated evolution of ultraconserved elements in mammalian and avian genomes```.

**Disclaimer:** Although we welcome re-use of these materials, except where noted the code we are sharing here is specific to this project and to the high performance computing platform of Northwest A&F University. 

Organization of this repository
------------

Each directory contains the scripts for a particular analysis, along with a README describing
that analysis. In many cases logs and/or output files are also stored in a subdirectory 
under each analysis. Numbers refer to the sections of the methods in the accompanying manuscript.
